# Vanilla JS todo-app synced with Firebase
 
<h1>What can it do</h1>
* The list is saved on Firebase.
* Single page app, no loading after the initial load.
* Drag & drop functionality for both mobile and desktop.
* To do tasks order is saved and updated when changing.
* Dark and Light theme.
* Filter buttons for filtering active/completed/all to do tasks.
* User theme choice and filter choice are saved on a cookie and loaded on the next visit w/out flickering.
* Animations for every action, no abrupt jumps.

Cons
* Only 1 user and only 1 task list, built only for myself.
* Not so light animations which can cause stutter on low-end mobile phones.
* No server side preloading or server side optimizations.
* May be some uncaught bugs.
* Vanilla JS, not the best practices.
